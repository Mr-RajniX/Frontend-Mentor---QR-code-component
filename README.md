## _My process_

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   inline-block

### What I learned

By doing this, I learnt lots of new things about CSS. As my CSS knowledge is not so great but this project gives me a reason to find why! Also I learnt about git n GitHub and this too.

This is how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
    console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
